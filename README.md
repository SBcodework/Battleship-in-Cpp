# Battleship-in-Cpp
A game project of battleship made in C++.
Tested, basic functionality should be achieved first, then features can be added.

# Comments 
Imported from existing. The first commited build has basic functionality and a basic AI. Despite what Github may say about a small precentange of this project being C, it is fully C++. This was one of my first larger C++ projects.
